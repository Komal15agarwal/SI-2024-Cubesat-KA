## My Journey through an Internship in Introduction to CubeSat and Satellite Commuincation
### Embarking on an internship in Introduction to CubeSat and satellite communication has been an exhilarating journey filled with learning, challenges, and significant growth. Here's a glimpse into my experience and what I've gained from this transformative opportunity.

### What are Cubesats?
CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that use a standard size and form factor.  The standard CubeSat size uses a “one unit” or “1U” measuring 10x10x10 cms and is extendable to larger sizes; 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and even 12U.  Originally developed in 1999 by California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) and Stanford University to provide a platform for education and space exploration.

NASA Ames launched its first CubeSat, GeneSat, in December 2006.  Since then Ames has launched 16 CubeSat spacecraft varying in size from 1U to 3U with an additional 12 CubeSats in development or awaiting launch.
